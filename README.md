# Algorithm Challenge #49 – Custom Ceil Function in C++

🧮 Problem Description 
-
This challenge implements the **ceiling (ceil)** operation manually,
without using the built-in `ceil()` function in C++.

The ceiling function returns the **smallest integer greater than or equal**
to the given number. Handling negative numbers correctly is the key challenge here.

📐 Ceil Logic Breakdown
-
- If the number has a fractional part:
  - Positive → move to the next integer
  - Negative → keep the integer part
- If the number is already an integer → return it as-is

Examples:
- 10.8  → 11  
- -10.8 → -10  
- 7.0   → 7

🧠 Skills Strengthened
-
- Extracting fractional parts from floating-point numbers
- Applying mathematical definitions precisely
- Handling positive vs negative edge cases
- Writing custom alternatives to standard library functions
- Improving algorithmic accuracy and reasoning

🧪 Example Run
-
**Input:**  
Enter Float Number  
-4.3  

**Output:**  
My Ceil = -4  
C++ Ceil = -4
